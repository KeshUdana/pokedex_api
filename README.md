- **Comprehensive Data**: The API covers a wide range of information about each Pokémon, including their base stats, abilities, and evolution details.
- **Fast and Reliable**: Optimized for quick responses, ensuring users can retrieve Pokémon data efficiently.

### Technologies:

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
